# MeetingTracker

MeetingTracker is a lightweight Swift-based iOS and watchOS application for tracking in-person meetings. It allows users to log the duration, time, and precise location of their meetings. The data is stored using SwiftData and visualized via a simple interface. The app supports Live Activities and Apple Watch communication using WatchConnectivity.

## Features

- üïí Start and stop meetings on iPhone or Apple Watch
- üìç Capture GPS coordinates (latitude & longitude)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Track and display meeting duration
- üß≠ Display real-time location using MapKit
- üì§ Sync data between Apple Watch and iPhone
- üß© Live Activity support with Dynamic Island integration
- üóÇÔ∏è Store meetings using SwiftData

## Project Structure

| **File**                      | **Description** |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| `Meeting.swift`              | Defines the main data model used across the app |
| `newMeeting.swift`           | Handles the user interface for starting and stopping meetings on iPhone, recording the start time, tracking duration, and saving meeting data to SwiftData. |
| `LocationManager.swift`      | Manages user location authorization and provides real-time updates using `CLLocationManager`. Publishes the user's last known coordinate. |
| `MeetingDetails.swift`       | Displays detailed information about individual meeting records including duration and geographic location. |
| `WatchConnector.swift`       | Handles communication from the iPhone side, receiving data from the Apple Watch and inserting it into the SwiftData model context. |
| `WatchToIphoneConnector.swift` | Handles communication from the Watch side, sending meeting data to the paired iPhone using `updateApplicationContext()`. |
| `ContentView.swift` (iPhone) | Shows main interface of app and list of saved meetings. |
| `ContentView.swift` (watchOS)| Provides the interface on Apple Watch to start and end meetings, using timers and location updates, then synchronizes the data with the iPhone. |
| `MeetingWidget.swift`        | Handles the display of Live Activities and Dynamic Island content. |
